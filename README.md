# Open-Source-Joystick-Platform
for Investigating Forelimb Motor Control, Auditory-Motor Integration, and Value-Based Decision-Making in Head-Fixed Mice

Within this repository, you will find two main folders, each corresponding to a different behavioral paradigm: the auditory-motor decision-making paradigm and the value-based paradigm.

Each folder is organized into three subfolders:

3D_Designs: Contains all the 3D model designs for that version of the task.
Codes: Contains Arduino code to run the behavior and Python scripts to save text files.
Matlab: Contains example data, code to collect all metrics used in the paper, and functions for the complete analysis.
Additionally, each folder includes README files with further details about the contents.
